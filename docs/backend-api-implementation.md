# Backend API Implementation Summary

## API Structure Evolution

The project has been migrated from Payload CMS Express-based endpoints to Next.js App Router API routes. All active API endpoints now follow the Next.js App Router structure in `/src/app/(payload)/api/` or `/src/app/api/`.

## Backend API Routes Implemented

1. **Company Info API** (`/api/company-info`)
   - Provides full company information for pages like Contact and About
   - Includes comprehensive company details, contact information, social media links, etc.
   - Supports authentication check if required

2. **Header Info API** (`/api/header-info`)
   - Lightweight endpoint specifically for website header components
   - Returns only essential data needed for the header (name, phone, logo, etc.)
   - Optimized for performance with minimal data transfer

3. **Health API** (`/api/health`)
   - System status and health check endpoint
   - Supports both GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests
   - Provides version, timestamp, and environment information
   - The most current implementation is in `/src/app/api/health/route.ts`

4. **Contact API** (`/api/contact`)
   - Handles contact form submissions from website users
   - Stores submission data in the ContactSubmissions collection
   - Validates input data before processing

## CORS Configuration

All endpoints are properly configured with CORS headers to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend:

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: '*' (in development) or specific frontend domains (in production)
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`: Appropriate methods for each endpoint
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`: 'Content-Type, Authorization'
- OPTIONS method handlers for preflight requests

## Database Structure Updates

1. **CompanyInfo Global**
   - Added 'zalo' field to socialMedia section
   - Ensures consistent structure for frontend data needs

## Testing

Test scripts have been created for key endpoints:
- `test-health.js`: Tests the health endpoint functionality
- `test-header-info.js`: Tests the header information API

All test scripts have been moved to the `/test` directory for better organization and can be installed to the public directory using the updated `install-to-public.bat` script.

## Documentation

API documentation has been updated and organized:
- `health-endpoint-docs.md`: Documentation for the health endpoint
- `header-info-api-docs.md`: New documentation for the header info API
- `frontend-integration-guide.md`: Comprehensive guide for connecting frontend with backend APIs
- All documentation is now stored in the `/docs` directory

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration**
   - The frontend code doesn't need modification yet, as requested
   - A custom hook (`useHeaderInfo.ts`) has been created and is ready to be integrated when needed
   - The API structure follows the expected format documented in the frontend integration guide

2. **Production Deployment Considerations**
   - Update CORS settings to use specific origin domains instead of '*'
   - Consider implementing rate limiting for public endpoints
   - Add monitoring for API performance and errors
