### Migration Script

A migration script (`migrate-categories.js`) was created to add type information to existing categories based on their usage in different collections.

## Usage Notes

### Category Management

When creating categories, always select the appropriate type from the dropdown:

### Collection Organization

Collections are now grouped logically in the sidebar:

- **Products & Ecommerce**: Contains products and product-related collections

## Troubleshooting

### Hydration Errors

If you encounter any React hydration errors:

1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Run the hydration test script: `test-hydration.js`
3. Review any client-side components to ensure they're wrapped with `HydrationSafeWrapper`
4. Verify that browser APIs are accessed safely using the provided utility functions

### Category Issues

If categories aren't filtering correctly:

1. Run the category filter test script: `test-category-filters.js`
2. Check that categories have the correct type assigned
3. Verify the filter conditions in collection configurations
